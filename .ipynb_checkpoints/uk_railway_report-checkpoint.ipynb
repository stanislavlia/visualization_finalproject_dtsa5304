    "are potentially to be the most interesting for *Railway management and stakeholders*. The **goal** of this project is to *design and evaluate a dashboard for monitoring ticket price distribution for different trips*. In this project, **visual task** that we optimize our dashboard for is \"*to discover bussiness-valuable inisghts from data related to ticket price, classes of passengers and payment methods and to be able to quickly get the summary picture for any route*\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achive the goal and help users complete *visual task*, I have prepared a few **Low-fidelity prototypes** of dashboard and select the most suitable one. Once I decided which prototype should be taken, I started to design the dashboard with *more details* and finally implemented the dashboard using **Altair and Streamlit**.\n",

    "The dataset comes from **Kaggle** ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/motsimaslam/national-rail-uk-train-ticket-data) and contains data about **UK Railways Train Tickets** such as *ticket price, type of ticket, payment method, passenger class* etc, **spanning from January to April 2024**. It includes detailed information on various aspects of train journeys, providing insights into the travel patterns and pricing within this period. The dataset encompasses the following key attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ticket Type**: The category of the ticket, such as single, return, or season.\n",
    "- **Journey Date & Time**: The date and time for each train journey, including both departure and arrival times.\n",
    "- **Departure Station**: The station from which the journey originates.\n",
    "- **Arrival Station**: The station at which the journey concludes.\n",
    "- **Ticket Price**: The cost of the ticket in GBP.\n",
    "- **Other Details**: Additional information that might include passenger class, train service provider, booking reference, and any applicable discounts or offers.\n",

    "#### Discussion and selection\n",
    "I've come up with 3 slightly different sketches that can potentially become a prototype for our dashboard. They all share similar goals to show stakeholders **distribution of ticket price along with additional categorical data (Ticket Class and Type, Purchase Type) and option to select any Source and Destination.** The sketched dashboard differ in coloring, positions of plots and type of plots. Let's discuss which prototype should be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among all prototypes, I would like to choose **the third (yellow) one** for several reasons:\n",
    "- Yellow/Golden color fits better as it is associated with money or value (in my opinion)\n",
    "- Average manager likely finds it simpler to interpret binned discrete histogram rather than density plot\n",
    "- Pie charts fit better than barplots because it is easier to see what category in what fraction contribute to the whole\n",
    "\n",
    "I have to point out that in any case, our selected prototype is likely not perfect and have its disadvantages, though for now, we consider this prototype as a good starting point. One additional improvement for this prototype might be some indicator that shows the **average ticker price** because it is likely an important information (It can be inferred from histogram, but you need to put a bit of effort).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it is time to get to implementation of the dashboard."
